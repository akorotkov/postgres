(This file does not appear in release tarballs.)

In a release or snapshot tarball of PostgreSQL, documentation files named
INSTALL and HISTORY will appear in this directory.  However, these files are
not stored in git and so will not be present if you are using a git checkout.
If you are using git, you can view the most recent install instructions at:
	http://www.postgresql.org/docs/devel/static/installation.html
and the current release notes at:
	http://www.postgresql.org/docs/devel/static/release.html

Users compiling from git will also need compatible versions of Bison, Flex,
and Perl, as discussed in the install documentation.  These programs are not
needed when using a tarball, since the files they are needed to build are
already present in the tarball.  (On Windows, however, you need Perl anyway.)
